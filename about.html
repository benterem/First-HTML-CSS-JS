            <p>Darth Plagueis was a male Dark Lord of the Sith who, at some point prior to 
                the Invasion of Naboo, chose Sheev Palpatine, a human from Naboo, as his apprentice. 
                As master and disciple, Plagueis and Palpatine worked together for years, trying to unlock the secrets of immortality 
                as Plagueis lusted for it and to execute their order's long-percolating plan 
                of supplanting the Galactic Republic with a new Sith Empire. While training Sidious, Plagueis 
                taught him that two Sith were required for their perilous machinations. So, 
                if they worked together in accordance to the Rule of Two, with one of them 
                serving as a bait for the dark side of the Force and the other as a vessel, 
                they would succeed in acquiring the ability to harness the full power of 
                the dark side and rule immortal for ten thousand years. Eventually, Plagueis 
                ended up discovering a way to achieve his so desired immortality: 
                transferring his consciousness to another body, essentially using bodies as 
                vessels. 
            </p>
            
            <p>According to Sidious, Plagueis was powerful enough that 
               he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians 
               to create life and keep the ones he cared about from dying, 
               a precious knowledge that awarded him the epithet of "The Wise".
               However, Plagueis also developed a belief that the Force could 
               "strike back" at him for his power.In truth, he became so powerful 
               that the only thing he still dreaded was losing his power. Ultimately, 
               Plagueis' only fear was bound to come true: at some point, Sidious 
               had learned everything he needed from his master, and had acquired 
               his own pupil in Darth Maul.
                As the Rule of Two mandated that only two 
               Sith—a master and an apprentice—could exist at any given time, one of them had to die. 
               Sidious disposed of Plagueis, 
               killing him in his sleep. As noted by Sidious, Plagueis didn't act fast 
               enough to prevent his own demise.

            <p> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis The Wise? I thought not. It’s not a story 
                the Jedi would tell you. It’s a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, 
                so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life… 
                He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. 
                The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. 
                He became so powerful… the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, 
                of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his 
                apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death, but not himself.
